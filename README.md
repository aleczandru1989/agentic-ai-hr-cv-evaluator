# HR CV Evaluator

HR CV Evaluator is an intelligent, chat-driven application that evaluates candidate CVs before they reach interviewers, ensuring alignment with a company’s defined role requirements and hiring standards.

At startup, the application loads a target job profile outlining the ideal candidate's attributes. Users then upload a CV in PDF format, which the system analyzes to extract relevant details. The result is a detailed evaluation report, including a percentage-based match score that reflects how well the candidate fits the profile—streamlining recruitment and boosting hiring precision.
